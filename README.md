## Motivation and goals

The goals of this project are the following:
- I. Exploratory Data Analysis of the datasets
- II. Rank Based Recommendations
    - This is the most simple system only based on ranking the article with the most interactions
    - New users will have recommendations based on this
- III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
    - This method consist into looking similar user in term of interaction with articles
- IV. Matrix Factorization
    - I will build a matrix decomposition using SVD


## Structure
This project is structure is the following:

- project_french_car.ipynb #main file where the analysis will be done

- README.md

- data
    - ADEME-CarLabelling.csv #data
